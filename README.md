## Instructions
The purpose of this assignment is to build an interpreter for the grammar given below using flex and bison. The input to the interpreter is a text file, whose name has to be given as a part of the command line in the console.

The interpreter, through the parser, must build an internal representation of the program given in the text file in the form of a simplified syntax tree, if there are no syntax errors. The parser, while constructing the simplified syntax tree, must do strong type checking and build a symbol table, which will be used during the interpretation process. If the parser finds a syntax error, it must report it and terminate the process.

Variables must be declared before use exactly once. If a variable is used and not declared, an error must be reported. Type mismatches must be reported as errors. The interpreter must do the interpretation by traversing the intermediate representation of the program.

Identifiers and numbers have to be recognized via flex using a standard definition, including negative numbers.

## Terminal Nomenclature
These are the names that will be used to refer to the lexicon in both Flex and Bison. Note that the prefix R stands for Reserved Words, S stands for Symbols, and V for Values.
